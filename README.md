# nature-wallapers-app
This program downloads from the Internet and changes the wallpaper if you run it.
The program works on Windows, but I plan to port it to Gnu/linux in the future.
This program downloads wallpapers for the site https://wallpaperscraft.ru/
The configuration file is located in the folder: C:\Users\%Users%\Pictures\
To compile the program use auto-py-to-exe, create installer with innosetup.
